This code contains two folders

1) feature extraction: extracts deep activations for image patches
2) pooling: pools these patches into a global vector

Please read readme in each folder to get details.

This code is based on the following paper:

Yunchao Gong, Liwei Wang, Ruiqi Guo, Svetlana Lazebnik. Multi-scale orderless pooling of deep convolutional activation features. ECCV 2014.
